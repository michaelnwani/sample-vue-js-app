# Background
- This is something I wrote around a year ago (~July 2018), with the help of a
Vue CLI to setup some minor boilerplate. Since then it hasn't been in use, 
so I've made it publicly available to showcase some of the used technology.
- Because of what I redacted in the codebase, it's not operational out of the box,
but I hope that the intent is clear :)

# Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Vue.js
- Terraform
- AWS resources (Fargate, Cloudwatch, Route 53)
- Webpack
- Docker Compose
- Various helper npm packages
